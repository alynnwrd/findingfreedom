        Each year around 600,000 people transition out of prison. All of these
        people need work to support themselves, their families, to successfully
        integrate back into the community, and to avoid recidivism. However, the
        unemployment rate for former inmates was over 27% in 2008 leaving it over five
        times higher than the national average at the same time and also higher
        than any other period in American history including during the Great
        Depression. Factors such as gender and race also play a huge role in
        this statistic. The overall percent of unemployment amongst formerly
        incarcerated individuals is only expected to grow in the coming years.
        Our goal with Finding Freedom is to provide a useful resume tool that will
        provide former inmates with a professional resume along with some
        helpful hints on the best practices that have been found to lead to job
        procurement
